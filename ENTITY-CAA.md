# HushBox Entity Contributor Assignment Agreement

Based on Harmony (HA-CAA-E-ANY) Version 1.0 — Adapted for LOME-AI LLC

Thank you for your interest in contributing to HushBox and other
software projects managed by LOME-AI LLC ("We" or "Us").

This contributor agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted
by an entity contributor to Us. This is a legally binding document, so
please read it carefully before agreeing to it. The Agreement covers
more than one software project managed by Us.

## 1. Definitions

"You" means the legal entity that Submits a Contribution to Us,
including any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with You, where "control" means (i) the power to
direct the affairs of such entity, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
(50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of
such entity.

"Contribution" means any work of authorship that is Submitted by You
to Us in which You own or assert ownership of the Copyright.

"Copyright" means all rights protecting works of authorship owned or
controlled by You, including copyright, moral and neighboring rights,
as appropriate, for the full term of their existence including any
extensions by You.

"Material" means the work of authorship which is made available by Us
to third parties. When this Agreement covers more than one software
project, the Material means the work of authorship to which the
Contribution was Submitted. After You Submit the Contribution, it may
be included in the Material.

"Submit" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
communication sent to Us or our representatives, including but not
limited to electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Us for
the purpose of discussing and improving the Material, but excluding
communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

"Submission Date" means the date on which You Submit a Contribution
to Us.

"Effective Date" means the date You execute this Agreement or the
date You first Submit a Contribution to Us, whichever is earlier.

"Media" means any portion of a Contribution which is not software.

## 2. Grant of Rights

### 2.1 Copyright Assignment

(a) At the time the Contribution is Submitted, You assign to Us all
right, title, and interest worldwide in all Copyright covering the
Contribution.

(b) To the maximum extent permitted by the relevant law, if such
assignment cannot be made, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide,
exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable license under the
Copyright covering the Contribution, with the right to sublicense
such rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to reproduce,
modify, display, perform and distribute the Contribution as part of
the Material.

(c) To the maximum extent permitted by the relevant law, if such
license cannot be granted, You irrevocably waive and agree never to
assert such rights against Us, any of our successors in interest, or
any of our licensees, either direct or indirect.

(d) Upon such assignment of rights to Us, to the maximum extent
permitted by the relevant law, We immediately grant to You a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,
irrevocable license under such rights covering the Contribution, with
rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to
reproduce, modify, display, perform, and distribute the Contribution.
The intention of the parties is that this license will be as broad as
possible and to provide You with rights as similar as possible to the
owner of the rights that You transferred. This license back is limited
to the Contribution and does not provide any rights to the Material.

### 2.2 Patent License

For patent claims including, without limitation, method, process, and
apparatus claims which You own, control or have the right to grant,
now or in the future, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license,
with the right to sublicense these rights to multiple tiers of
sublicensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import
and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Contribution in
combination with the Material (and portions of such combination). This
license is granted only to the extent that the exercise of the
licensed rights infringes such patent claims.

### 2.3 Outbound License

Based on the grant of rights in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, if We include
Your Contribution in a Material, We may license the Contribution
under any license, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or
proprietary licenses.

### 2.4 Moral Rights

If moral rights apply to the Contribution, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, You waive and agree not to assert such moral rights
against Us or our successors in interest, or any of our licensees,
either direct or indirect.

### 2.5 Our Rights

You acknowledge that We are not obligated to use Your Contribution as
part of the Material and may decide to include any Contribution We
consider appropriate.

### 2.6 Reservation of Rights

Any rights not expressly assigned or licensed under this section are
expressly reserved by You.

## 3. Agreement

You confirm that:

(a) You have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement on
behalf of the entity You represent and to bind that entity to its
terms.

(b) Each Contribution is an original work of authorship, and You own
the Copyright and patent claims covering the Contribution which are
required to grant the rights under Section 2.

(c) The Contribution does not contain code or content owned by third
parties, unless You have disclosed such third-party code to Us and
have the right to Submit it under the terms of this Agreement.

(d) The grant of rights under Section 2 does not violate any grant of
rights which You have made to third parties.

(e) You have informed Us if You do not own the Copyright in the
entire work of authorship Submitted.

## 4. Disclaimer

EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN SECTION 3, THE CONTRIBUTION IS
PROVIDED "AS IS". MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT
ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO US AND BY US TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT
THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS
LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.

## 5. Consequential Damage Waiver

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
YOU OR US BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED
SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL
AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE
LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH
THE CLAIM IS BASED.

## 6. Miscellaneous

6.1 This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Indiana excluding its conflicts of law
provisions. Under certain circumstances, the governing law in this
section might be superseded by the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("UN Convention") and
the parties intend to avoid the application of the UN Convention to
this Agreement and, thus, exclude the application of the UN Convention
in its entirety to this Agreement.

6.2 This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and Us
for Your Contributions to Us and overrides all other agreements or
understandings.

6.3 If You or We assign the rights or obligations received through
this Agreement to a third party, as a condition of the assignment,
that third party must agree in writing to abide by all the rights and
obligations in the Agreement.

6.4 The failure of either party to require performance by the other
party of any provision of this Agreement in one situation shall not
affect the right of a party to require such performance at any time in
the future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one situation
shall not be considered a waiver of the performance of the provision
in the future or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.

6.5 If any provision of this Agreement is found void and
unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible
with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original
provision and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential
purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent
possible under law.
